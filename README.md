# Omni-LIVO
This repository contains the implementation and dataset for Omni-LIVO, a tightly-coupled multi-camera visual-inertial-LiDAR odometry system. Our system effectively bridges the spatial perception mismatch between wide-FOV LiDAR sensors and traditional narrow-FOV camera setups through innovative cross-camera direct tracking and unified optimization.
Omni-LIVO is a multi-camera extension of FAST-LIVO2 with enhanced robustness for LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Odometry(FAST-LIVO2-MultiCamera). This project extends the original framework to support multiple cameras for improved tracking performance in challenging environments. To match the wide field of view of modern LiDAR sensors, multiple cameras must be hardware-synchronized with external triggering to ensure precise temporal alignment.

## Status
🔧 **Pre-release Engineering Version** – A pre-release version of the project has been made available. This version includes a basic engineering implementation of the system, but does not yet incorporate robustness optimizations. These features will be included in future releases.

🚧 **Work in Progress** - More documentation and examples will be added as the project develops.

📝 **Paper Under Review** - Our paper is currently under review. The complete source code will be released upon acceptance.

*Detailed documentation and paper will be available upon publication.*
## Acknowledgments

We sincerely thank the authors of [FAST-LIVO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST-LIVO2) for their outstanding work and for making their code open source. This project would not have been possible without their excellent foundation in LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Odometry. We are grateful for their contribution to the robotics and SLAM community.
Special thanks to:
- The FAST-LIVO2 development team at HKU-MARS
- The entire open-source robotics community for their collaborataive spirit

### Sensor Configuration

Our multi-sensor data collection platform features the following specifications:

| **Component** | **Model/Type** | **Specifications** | **Frequency** |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **LiDAR** | LIVOX MID360 | • 360° horizontal FOV<br>• 59° vertical FOV<br>• 0.1-70m range<br>• 200,000 pts/s | 10 Hz |
| **IMU** | ICM40609 (built-in MID360) | • 6-DOF inertial measurement<br>• Accelerometer + Gyroscope | 200 Hz |
| **Camera Array** | JHEM306GC-HM | • 1024×768 resolution<br>• Cross-pattern configuration<br>• Hardware-level synchronization | 10 Hz |

### Camera Configuration

The four cameras are strategically arranged in a **cross-pattern configuration** to achieve near-omnidirectional visual coverage:

```
    Camera Front
         |
Camera ----- Camera
Left         Right
         |
    Camera Rear
```

This configuration synergistically complements the 360° LiDAR perception, enabling robust tracking even when objects transition between different camera views.

## Environment Requirements
- Omni-LIVO environmrnt is as same as FAST-LIVO2

### Ubuntu and ROS
- Ubuntu 18.04~20.04
- [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)

### PCL && Eigen && OpenCV
- PCL>=1.8, Follow [PCL Installation](https://pointclouds.org/downloads/)
- Eigen>=3.3.4, Follow [Eigen Installation](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- OpenCV>=4.2, Follow [OpenCV Installation](https://opencv.org/get-started/)

### Sophus
Sophus Installation for the non-templated/double-only version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/strasdat/Sophus.git
cd Sophus
git checkout a621ff
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### Vikit
Vikit contains camera models, some math and interpolation functions that we need. Vikit is a catkin project, therefore, download it into your catkin workspace source folder.

```bash
# Different from the one used in fast-livo1
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/xuankuzcr/rpg_vikit.git 
```

## Build

Clone the repository and catkin_make:

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/HIAS-VPD-LAB/Omni-LIVO/
cd ../
catkin_make
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

## Configuration

### Multi-Camera Setup

1. **Camera Parameters**: Configure camera intrinsics in `config/your_dataset_cam.yaml`
2. **Multi-Camera Extrinsics**: Set camera-to-LiDAR transformations in your main config file
3. **Topics**: Update image topics for each camera

Example multi-camera configuration:
```yaml
extrin_calib:
  cameras:
    - cam_id: 0
      img_topic: "/cam0/image_raw"
      Rcl: [rotation_matrix_3x3]
      Pcl: [translation_vector_3x1]
    - cam_id: 1
      img_topic: "/cam1/image_raw"
      Rcl: [rotation_matrix_3x3]
      Pcl: [translation_vector_3x1]
```

## Run

```bash
roslaunch fast_livo mapping_mid360.launch
rosbag play YOUR_DOWNLOADED.bag
```

## Dataset Support

Currently tested with:
- Hilti SLAM Challenge 2022 dataset
- Hilti SLAM Challenge 2023 dataset
- New College dataset
- Custom multi-camera dataset with mid360 and 4 cameras
